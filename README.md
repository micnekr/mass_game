# An proof-of-concept Unity game

A small project I wrote in Unity to see if I can do the following:
- Special effects (e.g. a camera dipping and a dust cloud appearing when landing, a lines particle effect when moving at high speeds)
- A physics-based player controller
- A physics-based game mechanic (left click emits a beam that increases the mass of the objects it touches, right click decreases the mass)
- Decals and beam special effects
- Breaking objects on impact (a wall gets broken by a falling ball)
- Basic 3D modelling
